# Tyto
The Tyto project attempts to create a complete application for any video survailance configuration as a NVR server and client.  It allows for flexability in integrating custom nodes into the survailance architecture like ESP-CAMs, Raspberry Pis, and/or any computer connected to one or more cameras.
